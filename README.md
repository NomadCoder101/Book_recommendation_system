 Build a system to recommend new books for you to read.   start by downloading the data, which was scraped from Goodreads.  The data files are large (hundreds of millions of rows), so we'll use some tricks to process this data on our local machine. 
 Then, we'll build a search engine to search the dataset for books that we've read.  Finally, we'll use the list of books we've read to find recommendations from others.

At the end we'll have a personalized list of book recommendations,along the way, we'll use pandas, scikit-learn, and numpy.  For processing large data sets, tf-idf, cosine similarity, and styling pandas dataframe columns.
